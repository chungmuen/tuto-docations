			<h2> Introduction: </h2>
			<p>
				In this tutorial we are going to explore the new GitHub functionality that was released during
				the GitHub Galaxy event that took place in November 2019. <br>
				Some of you may have noticed a new tab in you GitHub repositories called <em>Actions</em> which are
				automated workflows running on GitHub virtual machines (referred to as VM in this tutorial).
			</p>
			<img src="assets/actions_tab.png" alt="The new GitHub action tab">
			<p>
				Throughout this tutorial we will explore this new functionality using a simple JavaScript application
				for which we want to automate some development steps. <br>
				The application will contain a very simple JavaScript class (and a mapping file) for which we wrote
				some code documentation using <a href="" target="_blank" class="jsdoc">jsdoc syntax</a>. Below is a
				snippet we created with this small class:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col col-12">
			<div class="container">
				<div class="card">
					<div class="card-header" id="name">
					</div>
					<div class="card-body">
						<div id="sequence">DNA sequence: </div>
						<div id="RNA"></div>
						<div id="Translated"></div>
					</div>
					<div class="card-footer">
						<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" onclick="transcribe()">Transcribe</button>
						<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" onclick="translate_sequence()">Translate</button>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="col col-12">
			<p>
				For larger applications with multiple versions, keeping track of documentations is tidy. Indeed,
				every time a jsdoc comment undergo a modification or is created, we need to (re)generate the documentation using the command: <br>
			</p>
			<pre class="code"> jsdoc -c documentation.conf.json </pre>
			<p>
				<b>Note:</b> <em>"-c"</em> points to a configuration file. We will set everything later on by forking a git repository. <br>
				The objective of this tutorial is to completely automate the pipeline that generates the documentation so that we can
				focus on writing the jsdoc comments. We will rely on GitHub Actions to make sure every time a commit is made to
				a branch, the documentation is generated by the jsdoc tool inside a VM hosted on github. The final step will involve
				automatically pushing the documentation HTML files, from within the VM, into the branch that triggered the build. <br>
				<b>Note:</b> An action cannot trigger itself when using <em>${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}</em> (see below).

			<h2> Setting up the project:</h2>

			<p>
				The source code required by this tutorial has been created for you and can be found inside the corresponding github
				repository. Fork <a class="repo" href="" target="_blank">this GitHub repo</a> to make it your own and clone it locally. <br>
				Enter the directory and run the above command to install all dependencies:
			</p>
			<pre class="code"> npm install</pre>
			<p>
				The <em>package.json</em> file contains all the library declarations npm needs for installation. Some of these
				libraries are used by the tutorial itself (like bootstrap), so if you only want the hard dependencies (jsdoc and its templates)
				run the install in production mode with <em>--production</em>. Once installed you can pop the application using:
			</p>
			<pre class="code">serve</pre>
			<p>
				If you get a message that <em>serve</em> isn't installed, either use /node_module/path/to/serve or install it globally with <em>npm install -g serve</em>.
				Now go to <a href="" class="localhost" target="_blank">http://localhost:5000/src</a>. If you don't see this page then something went wrong. You could use another web server
				(Apache, NGINX, ...), it doesn't really matter.
			</p>
		</div>
	</section>

	<section class="row" id="local">
		<div class="col col-12">
			<h2>Generate the documentation locally</h2>
			<p>
				This step is going to be pretty easy as the class documentation has already been written for you. If you wish to explore it a little bit, just go to
				<em>src/components/</em> to find the <em>GeneFeature.js</em> file. Now run:
			</p>
			<pre class="code"> npm run doc:dev </pre>
			<p>
				This is an alias command borrowed from <em>package.json</em> under the <em>scripts</em> tag which will output its content
				to a directory ignored by Git. This is made on purpose so that you can deploy your documentation locally without ever
				deploying it on GitHub. You will end up with two directory: <em>documentation</em> should contain the final build, pulled from github;
				and <em>docTemp</em> which is your local version of the documentation.
				Have a look and see how the <em>doc</em> and <em>doc:dev</em> commands actually run jsdoc in the background. All configurations for jsdoc
				to generate that documentation are located inside <em>documentation.conf.json</em>. Have a you look if you wish to
				customize your documentation (change template and theme, change recursion depth, set up which files to be included or excluded, ...).
				By running this command, your jsdoc comments in the code are parsed and translated into HTML, the results being outputted into the
				<em>docTemp</em> directory. <br>
				Run <em>serve</em> again and go to <a href="http://localhost:5000/docTemp" target="_blank">http://localhost:5000/docTemp</a>
				to display the current documentation; here is how it should look like:
			</p>
			<iframe src="../documentation/GeneFeature.html" width="100%" height="800px" onLoad="self.scrollTo(0,0)"></iframe>
			<p>
				With this system set up, every time we write a new piece of code and its documentation or modify an existing one, we need to manually rerun the npm command
				that parses the files and generate our documentation in HTML. We then need to add these files to the current commit and push them on the remote branch.
				<br> This process can eventually become difficult to deal with, leading to merge conflicts between branches or a never up-to-date documentation. Let's automate it so that we don't have to
				trigger the commands manually on each commit.

	<section class="row" id="GH_actions">
		<div class="col col-12">
			<h2> Setting up an automated workflow</h2>
			<p>
				Now that we know our documentation works correctly, we will setup a GitHub workflow that pulls the current branch, triggers the <em>npm run doc</em> command and
				pushes back the generated HTML files to the same branch. <br>
				That piece of code has already been created for the sake of showcasing a real working example. This means the repository of this tutorial has this script running
				on each commit. <br>
				Open the <em>.github</em> directory: it contains all features, configurations and scripts related to the GitHub platform. For instance, some repositories may have a
				<em>ISSUE_TEMPLATE</em> directory to set up templates for users to open new issues. <br>
				Now open the <em>workflows</em> subdirectory which will contain a list of yml files: one for each workflow you want to run.
				You should see a <em>documentation.yml</em> file that contains the following code:
			</p>
			<pre class="code" id="tl;dr">
name: Doc
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: '10.x'
    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm install
    - name: Run the documentation
      run: npm run doc
    - name: Commit changes
      uses: elstudio/actions-js-build/commit@v2
      with:
        commitMessage: 'Autogenerated documentation files'
        wdPath: documentation
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}</pre>

			<p>
				The fully working pipeline is in this file so let's review it together. <br>
				The first line indicate the name under which the workflow will appear in the Actions tab. The second line indicates
				under which conditions should this workflow be executed. Here we choose push only but for a full list of
				conditions, check <a href="" target="_blank" class="actionConditions">this link</a>. <br>
				We then declare the <em>jobs</em> and <em>build</em> tag to start our workflow. Using the <em>runs-on</em> key we select
				an operating system: Mac OS, Windows or Linux (note that there are limitations on Mac OS) and then declare the sequential
				<em>steps</em> we want to execute. <br>
				We first want to pull the current code from this repository inside the VM. To do that we use an integrated action called
				<em>actions/checkout@v1</em> which code is available <a href="" target="_blank" class="checkout">here</a>. We then wish to
				setup a <em>node.js</em> version on our VM and, again, use an integrated action which you can find
				<a class="nodeSetup" href="" target="_blank">here</a>. Note how this time we are able to pass an extra parameter with the
				<em>with</em> keyword, that allows us to select a specific version of our tool. <br>
				Now that our code is cloned and our node version is selected we can install our libraries with <em>npm install</em>. Here we define
				the steps by giving them a name that will be displayed in the github console. <br><br>
				Everything is setup up so we can trigger the generation of our documentation with the command <em> npm run doc</em>. <br>
				We are now at the final step which involves committing back to the current branch. We are going to use yet another integrated action, this
				time from <a href="https://github.com/elstudio/actions-js-build" target="_blank"><em>elstudio</em></a>, that will handle that process for us.
				However, the following code should show you how to achieve this with a manual action:
			</p>

			<pre class="code">
- name: Commit to repository
  env:
	GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.github_token }}
	COMMIT_MSG: |
	  Autogenerated documentation
	  skip-checks: true
  run: |
	# Hard-code user configuration
	git config user.email "${GITHUB_EMAIL}"
	git config user.name "${GITHUB_ACTOR}"
	git remote set-url --push origin https://${GITHUB_ACTOR}:$GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY
	git checkout ${GITHUB_REF##*/}
	git add -f documentation/
	git diff --staged --quiet || (git commit -m "${COMMIT_MSG}"; git push)</pre>
			<p> Anyone can actually integrate their own actions (which is not the purpose of this tutorial). Remember to
				verify the source code an integrated action implements: you don't want to inadvertently delete your current branch. To
				do that you can check the
				<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/elstudio/actions-js-build/blob/master/commit/entrypoint.sh"><em>entrypoint.sh</em></a>
				file in the action repository.
				<br> Now, push the project to your github repository, go to Actions, and watch the magic happen.</p>

							documentation workflow.</figcaption>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p> Depending on the situation, you may want to wait until the build is finished and pull the code in your local branch.
				The template we use timestamps the documentation files, so every time the workflow is triggered the documentation pages will change
				with a new date and time. You may disable this options depending on the template used or switch to another templating
				system. You will have to pull the code each time the documentation is changed by the workflow anyway.<br>
				A particularity of this workflow is that we used the default github token to allow the action to commit back
				to the repo. This token does not have enough rights to process specific functions: it won't allow github
				to correctly rebuild the pages (if you use github.io). To do that you will need to create a new secret token in your
				repository settings, give it a name, and replace <em>${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}</em> with it using
				<em>${{secrets.MY_CUSTOM_SECRET}}</em>. Be careful, this token <b>CAN</b> trigger infinite loop actions
				so you will need to tweak your commit action by committing only to one branch and excluding that branch from the workflow.
				To exclude a branch, look at <a class="ignoreBranch" href="" target="_blank">this documentation</a>.
				<br>
				You can now get your badge and add it to your README.md file. It's easy:
			</p>
			<pre class="code">
[![Actions Status](https://github.com/"userName"/"repoName"/workflows/"workflowName"/badge.svg)](https://github.com/"userName"/"repoName"/actions)

			<h2> Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				I started using GitHub Actions for our new project as a replacement to travis.ci. As I explored
				the functionality, I discovered how powerful it was to automate the most boring tasks. One could
				imagine deployments to multiple cloud systems or publish on the gh-page build. <br>
				Actions are even more exiting than presented here. The technology running behind the scene is
				<a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">docker</a>, which means anyone can create its own
				integrated actions through the interaction of dockerfile and bash scripts. <br> <br>
				Hope this has been helpful to you !
